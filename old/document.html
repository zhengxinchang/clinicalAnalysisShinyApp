        CR was evaluated after two courses of induction chemotherapy, and was defined by morphologic examination of the

        0.5 x10<sup>9</sup>/L and platelet count ≥ 50.0 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L by day 36 of second course of induction.<span

        For OS, failure included death of any cause. For a case who abandoned treatment in early phase, if the case was
        known to have died with a known date of death, then the case was considered as a failure at the date of death;
        otherwise it was censored at the date of abandonment.&nbsp;

        For EFS, start of EFS time was defined to be the date of beginning Remission Induction I. EFS times for patients
        who failed induction were set to 0. Two types of EFS were defined (EFS1 and EFS2). Both types included death of
        any cause, relapse, and no response to induction as failures.
    </div>
    <div>
        In EFS1, for a case who abandoned treatment in early phase, if the case was known to have died, relapsed, or
        failed induction, then it was counted as a failure at the date of the failure event; otherwise it was censored
        at the date of abandonment.&nbsp;
    </div>
    <div>
        In EFS2, abandonment was considered as failure.

        <b>Cumulative Incidence of Relapse</b>

    <div>
        For cumulative incidence of relapse, failures included relapse after attaining CR or induction failure. Start
        time was defined as the beginning date of Remission Induction I. Time to failure of patients who failed
        induction was set to 0. Death while in CR was considered as a competing event. For a case who abandoned
        treatment early, if it was known to have relapsed with a date of relapse or to have failed induction, then it
        was counted as a failure; if it was known to have died in CR with a date of death, then it was counted as a
        competing event at the date of death; otherwise it was counted as a competing event at the date of abandonment.
